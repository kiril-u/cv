# Resume
[(kiril-resume-2021-1)](https://github.com/kiril-u/kiril-resume-2021-1)

My Current Résumé Template/Repository for "resume items" to mix and match according to job requirements.

it's a work in progress.

it might look outdated but i rather have a boomer-looking resume instead of a soydev one.

## directory tree:

- main (might be divided even further so the header items will become their own package if ill decide to actually make a template out of it)
	- English version
				- abstract
				- ~~skills section for an academic job offer~~
	- Hebrew version
- icons

## To Do

- [x] spend 70% of the total time spent writing your resume on figuring out how to make hebrew (RTL) work in LaTeX
- [ ] check for language mistakes (grammar or otherwise related)
- [ ] write an **IT version**
- [X] prepare a one page **general version**
- ~~[ ] add about current interests? CCNA/Python/Linux~~
