My Current Résumé Template/Repository for "resume items" to mix and match according to job requirements
it's a work in progress.

it might look outdated but i prefer that it looks old rather than *soydev*ish

## directory tree:

- main (might be divided even further so the header items will become their own package if ill decide to actually make a template out of it)
	- english version
				- abstract
				- skills section for an academic job offer
	- hebrew version
- icons

## To Do

- [x] spend 70% of the total time spent writing your resume on figuring out how to make hebrew (RTL) work in LaTeX
- [ ] check for langauge mistakes (grammar or otherwise related)
- [ ] prepare an **IT version**
- [ ] prepare a one page **general version**
- [ ] add about current interests? CCNA/Python
- [ ] something add about software im good with?
