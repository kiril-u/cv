	Graduate student in Educational Psychology characterized by strong autodidactic capabilities and curiosity for numerous scholastic, empirical, and artistic preoccupations. By learning to make use of these traits I acquired an ever-evolving set of skills thanks to which I am able to find, process, and communicate new ideas efficiently without sacrificing simplicity nor comprehensibility. I am highly concerned with others' well-being and as such, I tend to occupy myself by helping or treating other people.
